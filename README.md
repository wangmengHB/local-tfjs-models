# local-tfjs-models
This is a repo of local open source tfjs-models. 
For some reason you know, we can not fetch models from google storage service in some region of the world.
So we can not directly use the npm: @tensorflow-models.

This is a collection repo of tfjs-models. Then you can deploy these models in your local or cdn enviroment.
